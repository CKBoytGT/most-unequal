          <p>
            <strong>Lake Providence, Louisiana (CNN) —</strong> Delores Gilmore
            used to have a dream.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 44-year-old overnight prison guard grew up on the south side of
            Lake Providence, the crescent moon-shaped body of water that
            generally divides the haves from have-nots here in the northeast
            corner of Louisiana. It's a place where the air is so soupy-hot your
            shins sweat; where bugs are such a looping, whirring presence that
            it can feel like you're trapped in hell's version of a snow globe;
            and where the level of income inequality, as persistent as the bugs
            and humidity, is higher than any other parish or county in America.
          </p>

          <p>It's not a place where dreams live long.</p>

          <p>Not south of the lake, at least.</p>

          <p>
            North of Lake Providence, on a side of town Gilmore rarely sees,
            there are tennis courts and ski boats, swimming pools and manicured
            estates. The lake is less than a mile wide, but the north side might
            as well be a world away from Gilmore, who earns $8.50 per hour
            working 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and still is two months behind on some of
            her bills.
          </p>

          <p>
            "The first of the month, I pay the rent," she said. "The next check,
            I pay my light bills. Sometimes I won't pay my rent and I pay the
            light bill from last month – if they cut if it off. Then I pay the
            rent the end of the month. ...
          </p>

          <p>"I get it done. By the grace of God, I get it done."</p>

          <p>
            A dozen or so family members rely on her for financial support. Her
            daughter, who has three children, lives across the street in a
            trailer so leaky that, despite her efforts to tar the roof to
            prevent rain from seeping through, it has mushrooms growing from the
            ceiling, like something out of "Alice in Wonderland." Stray dogs
            hound her door.
          </p>

          <p>Gilmore's life is consumed with the needs of her family.</p>

          <p>
            "I'm not fooling anybody," she told me. "I don't have any friends.
            And that's sad. ... I go to work, come home, take them where they
            gotta go, if they gotta go somewhere, come back home, lay down, go
            to work.
          </p>

          <p>"That's what I do. All day, that's what I do."</p>

          <p>
            In her recurring dream, though, Gilmore got a peek at another life.
          </p>

          <p>
            She was in a big house – a nice house, nicer than any she'd ever
            seen.
          </p>

          <p>
            "It was beautiful," she said. "It had upstairs, downstairs. Four
            bedrooms upstairs, four bedrooms downstairs. It had a guesthouse in
            the back. It had four bathrooms. There was a living room and a
            sitting room. It was just beautiful."
          </p>

          <p>
            Gilmore, a stern but funny lady who answers the door saying, "What
            now?!" and carries a switch to church in case her kids act up, never
            wore shoes in the imagined house, only socks. Her real living room
            floor is made of splintered plywood. But the floors in the dream
            home were smooth as a skating rink. In the dream, Gilmore ran
            through the halls and slid across the floor in her socks – just like
            Tom Cruise in "Risky Business."
          </p>

          <p>In that moment, she felt free.</p>

          <p>
            <img
              class="illustration illustration-right"
              src="assets/images/illust-1.png"
              alt="Drawing of a trailer with huge mushrooms growing on it"
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            Gilmore told me about her dream while we were driving along the
            south side of Lake Providence in her 2005 maroon Ford Taurus, a pair
            of fuzzy dice and four air fresheners hanging from the rearview
            mirror. Cypress trees zipped by the car. The rich side of the lake
            was blurry as we drove parallel to the southern shore, but I knew it
            was there. I'd already met some of the wealthier northsiders and
            seen their lakefront homes. I'd also looked at the statistics: This
            place has a wider gap between rich and poor than Manhattan, with its
            Bentleys and billionaires – or than any country on Earth.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'd learned that, whatever we tell ourselves about America being the
            land of opportunity, our country's rules are designed to make it
            likely Gilmore will stay here on the south side of the lake, in the
            modest white trailer where she raised eight kids, including a
            stepson and a nephew whom, she said, her sister abandoned on a
            street corner in town.
          </p>

          <p>
            Personal choice, including her decision to have so many children,
            plays a role in it, of course, but the choices in front of her are
            limited by a host of factors, including an income that won't support
            her family.
          </p>

          <p>
            She doesn't blame anyone for that – doesn't bemoan the wealth here.
          </p>

          <p>She absolutely loves her job.</p>

          <p>
            But, to use a popular metaphor, the middle rungs of the economic
            ladder have vanished in Lake Providence. There's almost no middle
            class.
          </p>

          <p>How could a person climb up?</p>

          <p>
            As I listened to Gilmore recount her dream, however, anything seemed
            possible.

            fall at the bottom of an index or ranking. With 32,000 votes
            tallied, America's rich-poor gap was the top pick.
          </p>

          <p>
            In your eyes, it's the No. 1 social justice issue of our time – a
            continuation of the civil rights movement, which included a push for
            jobs and economic justice as well as racial equality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the late 1970s, the gap between rich and poor has widened to
            Grand Canyon proportions – pushing America toward a two-class
            society. People have a harder time getting ahead now than at any
            time since the Great Depression.

            East Carroll Parish, population 7,500 and home to Lake Providence,
            is worse off still.

            Lake Providence is a place of incredible natural wealth. It was
            named by people who floated down the Mississippi, past
            throat-slitting pirates, and found refuge at the beautiful,
            cypress-lined lake. "If a crew was fortunate enough to get safely
            past the pirates to the trading post at the lake below, they thanked
            Providence for sparing them," according to one local history.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Thus, the lake and settlement acquired the name of Providence."
          </p>

          <p>
            They were the chosen people – the ones God had spared a nasty fate
            on the river and led to the fertile land of the Mississippi Delta.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, Lake Providence is at the confluence of the river and two
            highways.
          </p>

          <p>It's well situated for economic development.</p>

          <p>Yet divisions hold it back.</p>

          <p>
            The rich largely live north of the lake and the poor on the south.
            They go to different churches and attend different schools. They
            have different friends and work different jobs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many of the richer people in town own land and run farms that
            produce corn, cotton and soybeans. Poorer people used to work on
            those farms, but they've largely been replaced by the
            Transformer-size machines you see driving along the road during
            harvest.
          </p>

          <p>There are few nonfarm businesses in town.</p>

            On the main strip, you'll find The Banner-Democrat, the local
            newspaper with half of the letters missing from its sign; a "Price
            Cutter Discount Center," which advertises balloons and party
            supplies in a community that seems to have need for neither; and a
            corner store called Unique Fashion, which is where I found Michael
            Owens on a summer afternoon, sitting in a metal chair in front of an
            industrial-strength circular fan.
          </p>

          <p>"How's business?" I asked.</p>

          <p>
            "DEAD!" he said, without pause. "I ain't seen a customer all day."
          </p>

          <p>
            The best a non-land-owning person can hope for here is a job at the
            prison (the sheriff's department is the largest employer), a bank,
            the schools or one of several restaurants, including The Dock, which
            sits on the lake and has a giant crawfish on its roof.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's also Uncle Darrell's, a convenience store on Second Street,
            on the south side of the lake. Everybody knows that, outside, that's
            where you're likely to find the drug dealers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Race is part of the divide, to be sure. Land was given to white
            families in the 1800s, not to blacks. The town resisted integration
            in the 1960s and '70s, and at least one voting rights activist was
            shot in the parish during that struggle.
          </p>

          <p>The history of slavery and discrimination is still present.</p>

          <p>
            But class has become the new barrier – one that is both persistent
            and legal.
          </p>

          <p>
            The richest 5% in the parish earns $611,000 per year on average.
          </p>

          <p>That's 90 times what the bottom fifth makes per year: $6,800.</p>

          <p>And 16% of parish residents are unemployed.</p>

            Despite the divide or maybe because of it, I was hard pressed to
            find people in Lake Providence who think income inequality,
            specifically, is a problem.
          </p>

          <p>This is the way things are, they say.</p>

          <p>Always will be.</p>

          <p>The gap is so big they no longer can see across.</p>

            Delores Gilmore's mother learned to sleep with the sound of wolves
            clawing at the walls of the family's two-room, wooden home on a
            cotton plantation.

            She used an outhouse instead of a toilet and pumped water from a
            spigot. In the middle of the night, instead of going outside to fend
            with wolves, she relieved herself in a "slop jar," a small container
            with a lid they kept next to the bed. For food, the family tended a
            garden, and her father hunted deer. But Dorothy Jones recalls living
            for a day or two at a time on nothing but water. "It was rough on
            the stomach," she said. "I know that."

            Jones, now 60, started working the cotton fields at 10. At 12, she
            became pregnant. She left school and kept working in the fields,
            strapping the infant to her back and walking up and down the rows of
            cotton, the white-hot sun breathing down on her.
          </p>

          <p>Her starting wage: $3 per day.</p>

          <p>But, like so many others here, she's not one to complain.</p>

          <p>"I guess I just had to get used to it," she said.</p>

          <p>
            Gilmore, her third child, was born in June 1969, six years after the
            March on Washington and six months before the federal government
            forced local public schools to integrate.
          </p>

          <p>
            She came into this world at a time of great hope – when it seemed
            like Lake Providence, a place that always had been segregated by
            race, might be entering a new era.
          </p>

          <p>Her mother staked her dreams on Delores.</p>

          <p>
            She was the resourceful one. She had a quick temper but also an
            infectious laugh. When the family ran out of food, she went looking
            for help from relatives.
          </p>

          <p>She rolled with the punches.</p>

          <p>It seemed like she might be the one to break free.</p>

          <p>One street in Lake Providence connects south to north.</p>
          <p>
            Heading north, the road curves past a furniture store with windows
            covered in American flags and massive images of Marilyn Monroe, the
            1950s movie star who spent part of her early life in foster care – a
            symbol of the idea that anyone can make it in this country.
          </p>

          <p>
            The road continues into neighborhoods with towering trees and
            well-trimmed lawns. Not all the houses on the north are massive.
            Some have the feel of a 1960s retirement community – stone
            birdbaths, lawn trinkets. A few trailer homes are in the mix. A
            quick drive-by could leave you with the impression there's not much
            wealth here. But squint past the trees and you'll see wrap-around
            porches, columns, a private tennis court, pools and manicured
            shrubs. The billionaire Sam Wyly grew up in town, and his cousin,
            according to his book "1,000 Dollars and an Idea," lives in an
            antebellum home north of the lake.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I grew up with the American idea that you pull yourself up by your
            bootstraps – that you work hard and you do the best job you can …
            and you make a living."
          </p>

          <p>
            That's Thomas Terral, 71, who's said to be one of the richer men in
            the parish.
          </p>

          <p>
            His family name is on a seed storage tower on the south side of
            town. The Terrals owned and operated several farm-related businesses
            for decades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Terral and other northsiders live by what I'll call the Bootstrap
            Ethic – that you can work hard, get a good education and get ahead.
            It's the American Dream, really.
          </p>

          <p>No complaints.</p>

          <p>
            The ethos has served Terral well, although it would be hard to argue
            he's needed it much. The son of a doctor, Terral told me he took
            over a part-family-owned seed business with a loan his father
            financed and, after he had made some payments, partially forgave.
          </p>

          <p>
            Terral Seed became the largest business of its kind in Louisiana
            under his watch. He sold it in 2010 to DuPont, the international
            chemical company,

          <p>He's a great businessman, sure.</p>

          <p>But it seems his bootstraps were pretty well pulled.</p>

          <p>
            He lives a life of relative luxury – nothing that would seem
            outlandish by national standards, but it is a far cry from life
            south of the lake. His living room has the vibe of an upscale ski
            lodge, with the heads of various animals – one is a bighorn sheep, I
            think – staring at you from elevated angles. In the office, a bear
            rug has its mouth open, fangs showing. Terral shot it with a bow and
            arrow on a hunting trip in British Columbia.

            On the coffee table is a copy of Forbes magazine. Cover story:
            "Peace Through Profits."
          </p>

          <p>That title embodies his thinking.</p>

          <p>
            "I felt like my mission was to supply as many jobs as I could," he
            said. "Of course, we were a small company, and I think the most
            employees we had was a little under 70 – 68 or so. What we did was
            probably the best thing we could do to help the situation."
          </p>

          <p>By "the situation," he means the poverty south of the lake.</p>

          <p>
            Some wealthy people north of Lake Providence won't speak of it – nor
            do they know much about the situation. Several declined my interview
            requests.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a feeling Terral was gracious enough to talk with me because
            he's seen the south side of the lake – and he has a genuine sense of
            service to the people there. He has volunteered on the south side,
            working on homes. And he met many people there as a young boy when
            he followed his dad on house calls. Terral would chat with families
            while his father, the doctor, tended to the sick and delivered
            babies.

      <div class="article-segment">
        <div class="article-wrapper">
          <p>Delores Gilmore was baptized in Lake Providence.</p>
          <p>
            It was 1979. She was 9. The only time she'd been in the water before
            that, she nearly drowned.
          </p>

          <p>She hasn't been in the lake since the baptism, she told me.</p>

          <p>
            On summer days, when the sun heats the gooey air to what feels like
            a boiling point, you'll see white families zipping up and down Lake
            Providence in pointy-nosed sport boats, dragging their children
            behind them on inner tubes and water skis.
          </p>

          <p>Occasionally the boaters wave to a stranger on shore.</p>

          <p>But it's almost unthinkable Gilmore could afford to join.</p>

          <p>
            By 16, Gilmore got pregnant and dropped out of school, just as her
            mother had. She went to work in the sweet potato fields west of
            town. And by the early 1990s, Gilmore had five children and was
            raising a stepson and a nephew.
          </p>

          <p>
            She didn't really have room for the extra kids in her crowded home.
            Nor did she have the money. She already was having trouble affording
            underwear for her own children.
          </p>

          <p>But they were family. She had to help.</p>

              >RELATED: How to help Lake Providence</a
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            Gilmore's nephew, then 11 months old, was abandoned by her sister on
            a street corner downtown, she and other family members said. Gilmore
            suspects her sister has an undiagnosed mental illness. She later
            would try to burn her mom's trailer down in a fit of rage – and
            would stab her mom, the family said, only to say she didn't remember
            the incidents afterward. She currently is serving a prison term,
            online records show.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gilmore isn't angry with her sister. She had problems no one here
            could seem to address.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gilmore kept striving for a sense of normalcy. For years, she had a
            boyfriend who helped.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was the father of four of her children, and he gave Gilmore a
            financial cushion and moral support. When they first met, she found
            him arrogant. But her friends convinced her to give him a chance.
            She eventually was drawn to a softer side he usually kept hidden.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, in 1994, only three years after the birth of her fifth child,
            Gilmore got a phone call that would change her life. Her boyfriend
            had been shot in the head.
          </p>

          <p>
            Two weeks later, his family pulled him off life support. His mother
            didn't want to pursue an investigation, Gilmore said, so the
            circumstances of his death remain unclear.
          </p>

          <p>The results were all that mattered to Gilmore.</p>

          <p>She lost her protector, and the kids lost theirs.</p>

            You could blame Gilmore's hardship on bad luck, but huge income gaps
            also are associated with gaps in empathy and trust, and that
            eventually morphs into hopelessness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Surprising links have emerged between income inequality and a host
            of social problems, including mental illness, substance abuse,
            incarceration, educational failure, teenage pregnancy, lower life
            expectancy, violence and infant mortality.
          </p>

          <p>Such links don't exist when you look just at average income.</p>

          <p>The inequality itself is to blame.</p>

          <p>
            This is well documented in a book called "<a
              href="http://www.amazon.com/Spirit-Level-Equality-Societies-Stronger/dp/1608193411/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382118260&sr=1-1&keywords=the+spirit+level"
              target="_blank"
              >The Spirit Level</a
            >" by epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett. Drawing on
            decades of work, the researchers found, essentially, that people who
            live in economically unequal places – such as Louisiana or the
            United States as a whole – tend to live harder lives.
          </p>

          <p>Not just poor people. All people.</p>

          <p>
            When the researchers plotted income inequality against an index of
            social problems that included infant mortality, mental health and
            others, they got the chart below, which shows that more unequal
            places tend to have more of these issues. The United States, the
            most unequal of the developed countries, for example, also has the
            world's highest incarceration rate and a higher infant mortality
            rate than comparable nations. Sweden, meanwhile, has a low level of
            income inequality and fares much better on these social measures.

              Social ills are associated with societies that have high income
              inequality, research shows.

          </figure>

          <p>
            When the researchers plotted the same data according to average
            income, the correlation dissolved – the poorer societies were not
            more likely to suffer the social ills:
          </p>

          <figure class="infographic">

            />
            <figcaption>
              No clear relationship exists between per capital income and social
              problems, research shows.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            The researchers suspect gaps in trust and empathy likely contribute
            to these gaps in health and social cohesion. More unequal societies
            also tend to have lower levels of trust, they found.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Louisiana, for example, only slightly more than a third of the
            population says it trusts most people, according to "The Spirit
            Level." In more-equal North Dakota, that number jumps to 67%.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inequality in America has grown in tandem with a host of factors.
            And things weren't always this way. In the 1950s and '60s, the U.S.
            was remarkably egalitarian. The economist and former Labor Secretary
            Robert Reich says he's often asked what society the United States
            should emulate if it wants to address income inequality.
          </p>

          <p>His answer: the United States.</p>

          <p>The '50s, '60s version.</p>

          <p>Back then, things were markedly different.</p>

          <p>
            Labor unions gave workers a voice. The minimum wage, adjusted for
            inflation, was higher than now. College was affordable. And the
            super-rich were taxed at a higher rate.
          </p>

          <p>The minimum wage is worth less now than it was in the 1960s.</p>

          <p>
            And the tax rate on the richest Americans, as the documentary "<a
              href="http://inequalityforall.com/"
              target="_blank"
              >Inequality for All</a
            >" noted, has dropped considerably.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meanwhile, the country's now famous 1% continues to coast through
            the wake of the economic recession.
          </p>

          <p>They're faring better than anyone else.</p>

          <p>
            These issues are national, but they affect the dynamics of life in
            Lake Providence, and of every other community in America, in ways
            that are both common and unique.
          </p>

          <p>
            In New York, where the mayor is a multibillionaire and the race for
            his successor has largely focused on this topic, inequality has
            skyrocketed as Wall Street traders and CEOs receive otherworldly
            compensation. In the Rust Belt, the decline of manufacturing jobs
            has helped hollow out the middle class, striking a serious blow to
            the idea that anyone who works hard, regardless of family
            background, can live an economically stable life.
          </p>

          <p>
            And in the Deep South, economic justice is an extension of civil
            rights.

          <p>
            Valtakia Jones, 22, has been looking for work for four years. She
            left school four months shy of graduation to care for her second
            child. For about a year, she gave up on the job search completely.
            She felt like she was unemployable – like something was wrong with
            her.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recently, she's gotten a second wind. There's still some fight left
            in her, but talk to her about the job search and you can hear the
            life start to drain from her voice.
          </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            Not long ago, she got an interview at McDonald's in Oak Grove,
            Louisiana, about a 20-minute drive west of Lake Providence, in the
            next parish over.
          </p>

          <p>
            If she were offered the job, she'd take it. But she doesn't know how
            she would get there. Her mom is the only one in the family with a
            car. Jones says she's hoping to walk to work, but that seems nearly
            impossible considering the job is more than 15 miles away.
          </p>

          <p>Maybe she could pay someone to drive her?</p>

          Jones said she would do anything to make it work.

          <p>
            For one, she wants to provide a safer place for her kids to live.
          </p>

          <p>
            The mother of three now lives in a sunken trailer across from her
            mom. Family members paid for the structure, which bows in the
            center, like a caterpillar inching forward. She's fixing it up the
            best she can. She painted half of the exterior blue before she ran
            out of paint; a friend helped her build a plywood cabinet to hold
            the sink.
          </p>

          <p>
            "If I can get this job, it's gonna be the bomb," she said of the
            trailer.
          </p>

          <p>Last I heard, McDonald's hadn't called back.</p>

          <p>Many people in Lake Providence never will climb out of poverty.</p>

          <p>The tools simply aren't available.</p>

          <p>
            Only 9% of kids from the bottom fifth of the earners in Lake
            Providence will make it into the top fifth, according to research
            from Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley.
          </p>

          <p>
            America has tried to create systems that are designed to ferry
            people from one side of the lake to the other, or to at least stop
            them from sinking further. Government programs help pay for health
            insurance and day care. Food stamps have kept families from going
            hungry.
          </p>

          <p>
            And public schools have proven one of the best routes out of
            poverty.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Lake Providence, however, the education system seems to
            underscore class divisions.
          </p>

          <p>Kids from the north side of the lake go to Briarfield Academy.</p>

          <p>Mascot: the Rebels.</p>

          <p>Graduation rate: 100%.</p>

          <p>It has no formal scholarship program, its principal said.</p>

          <p>On the south, there's only one public high school.</p>

          <p>Mascot: the Panthers.</p>

          <p>Graduation rate: 72.5%.</p>

          <p>
            I toured both high schools and met both of their principals. They
            genuinely want what's best for their students. But neither has the
            full support of the Lake Providence community. Neither can truly
            succeed without that.

            Middle-class jobs are another way for people to climb out of
            poverty. But those are scarce. Most jobs that do exist don't pay
            well enough for a person to meet his or her basic needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            That, too, starts to look more sinister when you look at the big
            picture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Across the country, workers are making just about what they did 30
            years ago. But they're also more productive than ever – producing
            far more stuff per hour now.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're making more stuff and getting paid the same, where are
            most of those gains in productivity going? If you guessed to the
            wealthiest Americans, you'd be correct.
          </p>

          <p>That affects how a person like Gilmore is paid.</p>

          <p>
            If her wages had kept pace with productivity, she would make $31,300
            per year, instead of about $18,000, according to an analysis by the
            <a href="http://www.epi.org/" target="_blank"
              >Economic Policy Institute</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>That's a wage that might actually be livable.</p>

          <p>I first met Gilmore at a birthday party for her grandchildren.</p>

          <p>
            Kids were orbiting her mother's trailer like fireflies. There were
            candles and cake. Above the kitchen sink hung a dirt-caked banner
            that said, "Rejoice!"
          </p>

          <p>
            I was amazed with how lighthearted the mood was, especially when I
            learned that Gilmore's mother and partner were going to be evicted
            from their home imminently.
          </p>

          <p>
            They fell behind on their payments when Willie Pullins Jr., 63, lost
            his job on one of the larger farms in the parish, they said. Pullins
            showed me a stub indicating he was paid $6 per hour. He told me he
            fell off the back of a truck on the job, and instead of getting
            sufficient medical assistance, he got the can. And now, an eviction
            notice.
          </p>

          <p>Gilmore is trying to find $3,500 to buy them a new place.</p>

          <p>
            "You have to help one another if you want to survive around here,"
            she said. "You ain't got nothin'. I ain't got nothin', but I'll give
            you whatever I've got."
          </p>

          <p>
            She's given so much that she's had to mortgage dreams of her own.
            Gilmore, who once worked as a certified nursing assistant, would
            like to go back to school to become a registered nurse. She's heard
            the pay is better, and she likes helping in times of need – doesn't
            like to see people suffer, especially children and older folks.
          </p>

          <p>But every month she has to take out a payday loan to get by.</p>

          <p>
            Such lenders are known to charge the equivalent of 300% interest.
          </p>

          <p>How could she possibly leave work, much less pay for school?</p>

          <p>
            Sheriff Wydette Williams, Gilmore's employer, told me he would like
            to pay his employees more but that the parish is bouncing back from
            financial crisis.
          </p>

          <p>
            "That is my whole goal – to provide the best for my employees," he
            told me. "This is not a political phrase. This is where I come from.
            I want to provide everyone with a decent wage and better working
            conditions..."
          </p>

          <p>
            During his tenure, he said, he brought health insurance to all of
            his full-time employees.

            Looking across Lake Providence from the north can warp a person's
            vision.
          </p>

          <p>
            Find a modicum of success and it becomes all too natural to judge
            those who haven't. There must be something wrong with them, right? I
            made it, so why can't they?
          </p>

          <p>It's not intentional or evil.</p>

          <p>It's the product of an unjust system.</p>

          <p>
            When the gap between rich and poor is as wide as it is in Lake
            Providence, it becomes almost impossible for people to imagine
            themselves on the other side.
          </p>

          <p>
            It becomes all too easy, as many do, to argue that "entitlement"
            programs such as food stamps are holding back people on the south
            side of the lake. They don't have enough incentive to work hard and
            get ahead. They become lazy, complacent, dependent.
          </p>

          <p>
            A closer look at how these programs work reveals another picture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Forty-five percent of the parish's residents receive food stamps, or
            SNAP benefits. The average payout is $1,492 per person per year.
          </p>

          <p>This is a top gripe of the northsiders.</p>

          <p>
            What you don't hear discussed as much is that they get help, too.
          </p>

              Both the rich and the poor are subsidized by government programs.

          <p>
            The U.S. Department of Agriculture spent $12.3 million in 2012
            subsidizing farming in East Carroll Parish through direct payments,
            insurance breaks and other subsidies, according to data compiled by
            the
            <a href="http://www.ewg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
              >Environmental Working Group</a
            >, which tracks government farm subsidies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The average farmer who gets a commodity subsidy in the parish
            received $20,554 in 2010, according to the group. The most highly
            subsidized farmer that year in East Carroll Parish got more than
            $655,000 from that one subsidy program.
          </p>

          <p>Look at that number again.</p>

          <p>$655,000.</p>

          <p>
            Farmworkers I spoke to made about $7.25 to $10 an hour, even after
            decades of work. Even in East Carroll Parish, where the cost of
            living is certainly nothing compared with major U.S. cities, those
            wages won't support a family. Business owners and farmers here are
            fond of saying they can't pay higher wages.
          </p>

          <p>That's hard for me to believe after looking at the subsidies.</p>

          <p>
            "It's really just an unprecedented income guarantee program," said
            Scott Faber, the Environment Working Group's vice president for
            government affairs. "It's absurd."
          </p>

          <p>
            The farm subsidy programs grew out of a desire to provide a stable
            source of food during the Great Depression. Some are still needed,
            but there is no cap, Faber said, on the income a farmer earns while
            still receiving government help. And some of the subsidies in East
            Carroll Parish go to the production of corn, some of which, local
            farmers told me, is shipped up the Mississippi River for processing
            into ethanol for fuel, not food.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lake Providence Mayor Robert Amacker, who farms 10,000 acres with
            his brother, told me some farmers would go out of business without
            the payments. They're needed, he said, because profits are tied to
            weather, which is completely unpredictable. But he didn't go so far
            as defending the full six-figure sums as always justified. "If you
            take 'em away it's probably gonna hurt us, but I'm not saying we
            won't survive," he said. "We have in the past."
          </p>

          <p>
            The U.S. House voted in September to cut

            On a recent Sunday, Gilmore was up by 11 a.m., only four hours after
            she'd gotten off work at the prison, to get her family ready for
            church at New Hope Baptist. She awoke to a wild scene: Grandma
            yelling at kids, kids running around looking for shoes.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was nearly noon by the time everyone was running out the door,
            which sticks so hard you have to pull it with two hands and all of
            your body weight.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of Gilmore's grandsons was last out of the trailer. As he ran
            toward the car his wide-brimmed hat flew off his head.
          </p>

          <p>"Hey!" he yelled at the wind.</p>

          <p>
            He mashed it on his head and it flew off not one but two more times.
          </p>

          <p>"My hat!"</p>

          <p>
            Gilmore's Ford Taurus, filled with seven people, pulled up to the
            church about 30 minutes after the two-hour service started. There
            are a few dozen churches in the parish. That's no coincidence,
            especially south of the lake. Folks turn to God when the world
            around them becomes too much to bear. For Gilmore, it's a place of
            solace.
          </p>

          <p>
            The family piled into pews in the back and watched as the Rev.
            Michael Owens, the storeowner who rarely sees customers, delivered a
            sermon about the economy.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was far more than a sermon, really. Owens pressed his mouth up
            against a microphone and ran all over the front of the sanctuary as
            he half-yelled, half-sang a series of parables and proverbs about
            getting by in the modern world.
          </p>

          <p>"I wonder if I have a WITNESS in here!?"</p>

          <p>"Yes pastor!" said Gilmore.</p>

          <p>They went back and forth like that seven times.</p>

          <p>
            "We got people that are desperate for jobs," Owens shouted,
            eventually becoming so worked up that he wiped his head with a
            towel. Sweat seeped through his pink tuxedo vest.
          </p>

          <p>
            "The Lord said, 'I will supply all of your needs according to my
            riches and gold.' He did NOT SAY he would supply your wants for ya."

          <p>"All right pastor!" Gilmore said.</p>

          <p>
            "If this town's gonna ever progress, we're going to have to come
            together!"

            The more time passed, the more worked up Owens became. He walked out
            in front of the podium and stood on one foot, shaking violently. One
            of the amplifiers in the small, wooden church was misfiring, and the
            speaker system occasionally let out deafening squeals.
          </p>

          <p>"I said, 'He'll do it!'" the reverend said.</p>

          <p>"Yes, he will!" Gilmore said.</p>

          <p>"He'll comfort ya!"</p>

          <p>Genuine progress has been made.</p>

            Myriant, a chemical manufacturing company, recently opened a place
            in Lake Providence with a $50 million grant from the Department of
            Energy.
          </p>

          <p>The company says it's created 50 new jobs.</p>

          <p>
            A woman from the south side of the lake opened a bustling restaurant
            called My Dream Eatery, which aims to pay its employees a living
            wage, not just the minimum.
          </p>

            I met several local public school graduates who were headed off to
            college this fall. Williams, the sheriff, is trying to rid the town
            of its drug problems. He's the first black sheriff in the parish's
            history, and he's respected by nearly everyone in town, including
            members of the white community. And a host of people has moved to
            Lake Providence to try to help the community move past its
            divisions.

          <p>
            An Irish-Catholic nun, Bernadette Barrett, or Sister Bernie as
            everyone calls her, said she moved here after her employer decided
            it would be more useful to send a mission of nuns to this part of
            Louisiana than to Haiti, which had been the plan.

            And on a recent Saturday, Lake Providence held an annual Soul Food
            Festival. People from both sides of the lake came together for corn
            bread, crawfish and chitlins.

            "We've got a long way to go, but, you know, for the last 38 years
            we've been going down, down, down, down. At some point, you have to
            hit bottom," Amacker, the mayor, told me. "When you hit bottom, the
            only place to go is up. I think we're almost there."

          <p>"You never dream about a big ol' house?"</p>
          <p>That's Gilmore talking to me in her maroon Ford Taurus.</p>
          <p>I wasn't sure how to respond.</p>
          <p>The reality is I don't dream about big houses and never have.</p>
          <p>
            I grew up in a two-story house with four bedrooms and 3½ baths. We
            had linoleum and then tile in the kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>I'm pretty sure I've slid across it in socks a time or two.</p>
          <p>I had it easy. Gilmore and others should, too.</p>
          <p>The problem with 2013 America is we don't believe that anymore.</p>
          <p>We believe in the rich and the rest.</p>
          <p>
            It seems obvious to us – or immutable – that some should have a
            better shot at financial success than others. That, in and of
            itself, is heartbreaking. We've lowered our expectations – resigned
            ourselves to a country where class determines worth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rich fund political campaigns, and politicians cow to their
            interests. Raising the minimum wage to the point that it's livable
            and increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans would help narrow
            the rich-poor gap, according to some economists.
          </p>
          <p>But politicians don't have incentive to pass those reforms.</p>
          <p>Many of the rich don't want them.</p>
          <p>
            It's remarkable to me that Gilmore and other poorer residents of
            Lake Providence are not more resentful. "They got money and I
            don't," she told me. "I don't feel bad. I guess I just wanna be
            blessed to be one of the ones that has money."
          </p>
          <p>
            For the most part, richer people I met in Lake Providence want to
            help, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Terral, the doctor's son and man of industry, has helped rebuild
            homes south of the lake.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I can't imagine that we in America would allow this to happen to so
            much of our people," said Tom Gattle, Terral's son-in-law, who runs
            a major river transportation service company in town.
          </p>

            Those attitudes tell me there's room for reconciliation – and shared
            empathy – in this place of haves and have-nots. There's room in
            America, too. If more of us saw how the other side of the lake
            lives, and if we really worked to understand the systems – the
            schools, the taxes, the wages, the history – that create and
            maintain economic injustice, I've got to think we'd work together to
            build a sturdier bridge to the other side.
          </p>
          <p>Those bridges need to start going up soon.</p>
          <p>
            The longer hard-working people such as Gilmore spin their wheels,
            the more likely they will become cold and resentful or, worse, give
            up.
          </p>
          <p>Gilmore puts her hopes in her youngest daughter, Shinya.</p>
          <p>
            Maybe the 9-year-old will be the first in her family to go to
            college?
          </p>
          <p>
            Gilmore has been tutoring Shinya, writing math problems on the walls
            in a back room in the trailer, where the family has a computer but
            no Internet. Shinya reads to her nieces and nephews, too, and makes
            them flash cards. That makes Gilmore think she'd make a good
            teacher. Or maybe a doctor.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I'm hoping for the doctor," she said, laughing. "I want her to be
            somewhere so she can be comfortable."
          </p>
          <p>Gilmore's own dreams, though, are fading.</p>
          <p>
            She'd like to go back to school to become a nurse, but she doesn't
            see how that is possible, financially or logistically. Too many
            people depend on her.
          </p>
          <p>And she hasn't dreamed about that big house in years.</p>
          <p>Hasn't glided across those slick floors in her socks.</p>
          <p>
            "I don't know what I dream about now, I be so tired when I lay down,
            I be so frustrated," she told me as we drove to work. "I don't even
            have a dream I guess."
          </p>
          <p>
            That may be the most frightening thing about the staggering economic
            inequality that plagues Lake Providence and modern America.
          </p>
          <p>It changes the way we see each other.</p>
          <p>And the way we see ourselves.</p>
